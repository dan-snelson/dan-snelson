## [Build Extension Attributes](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/25815/jnuc-2017-how-to-build-extension-attributes)

Making Jamf Pro extensible by allowing you to look at settings on a device is one of the most powerful (and sometimes easiest) things you can do. In this session, we will walk through how to use Extension Attributes. This includes how to create an Extension Attribute, how the Extension Attribute is run and how to scope policies around them. This is a beginner session, so while we won't teach you to write a script, we will show you how to grab basic information and initiate automated tasks from that information.
